This directory contains example Python scripts and C programs to measure the average emotion probabilities in an existing WAV file.

The Python script can be called like this:

   python3 OpenVokaWavMean-mac64.py path_to_sound_file.wav

The directory also contains the sound file hello.wav.
For this sound file, the result of the above commands with OpenVokaturi should be:

	Neutral: 0.760
	Happy: 0.000
	Sad: 0.238
	Angry: 0.001
	Fear: 0.000

A stand-alone C console program that measures the same as above can be created on the Mac with

cc -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99 -O3 -isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.5 VokaWavMean.c ../lib/macos/OpenVokaturi-3-3-mac64.o -o ../bin/OpenVokaWavMean-3-3-mac64

After this, you can run the resulting program on the example sound like this:

   ../bin/OpenVokaWavMean-3-3-mac64 hello.wav

and the result should be

   Neutrality 0.760
   Happiness 0.000
   Sadness 0.238
   Anger 0.001
   Fear 0.000

which is the same as with the Python script.
