Speaker1: Okay, I'm here.
Speaker2: Hi, I'd like to buy a Chromecast and I was wondering whether you could help me with that.
Speaker1: Sicily which color would you like we have blue black and red?
Speaker2: Let's get the black one.
Speaker1: Okay, great. Would you like the new Chromecast Ultra model or the regular compass?
Speaker2: Regular Chromecast is fine.
Speaker1: Okay. Sure. Would you like to ship it regular or Express?
Speaker2: Express, please.
Speaker1: Terrific. It's on the way. Thank you very much.
